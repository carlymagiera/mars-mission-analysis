# mars_mission_analysis

## Overview of Analysis and Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a web app that aggregate data about the Mission to Mars. To extract the data Splinter was used to automate a web browser and BeautifulSoup gathered the data. The scraped data is then stored in MongoDB. Finally, flask is used to create the web app that will display the information. The site features a button that can be used to execute scraping for the most up to date information.

## Results and Summary

The result of this project is a mission to mars web app. The page includes the latest mars news, a featured image of mars, mars facts table, and images of mars' hemispheres. The page can be updated to the latest information simply by clicking the 'scrape new data' button. 
The page has been further customized by stylizing the scraping button, adding a white well class to the features on the pages so they would pop against the dark custom background color that was added.
